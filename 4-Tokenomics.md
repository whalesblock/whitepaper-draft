# Tokenomics

**4. Tokenomics --- \$WLOCK (WhaleLock Token)**

**Introduction**

The **\$WLOCK Token** serves as the economic engine of the
**WhalesBlock** ecosystem, embodying the principles of **community,
value, and solidity**.\
The name *WhaleLock* combines two symbolic elements:

**["]{dir="rtl"}Whales + Block"**, a direct link to the WhalesBlock
brand;

**["]{dir="rtl"}Lock"**, representing commitment, trust, and the secure
nature of liquidity within the ecosystem.

The token is launched through a **fair-launch on
[[pump.fun]{.underline}](https://pump.fun/)**, ensuring a **transparent,
decentralized, and equitable distribution**.\
There are no presales, no private allocations, and no insider advantages
--- every participant enters under the same conditions, reinforcing the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s philosophy:

*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale builds its own block."*

**Token Distribution (pump.fun model)**

Because pump.fun does not support private or manual pre-allocations,

progressively** after launch, through **buyback and redistribution
mechanisms** managed by the **WhalesBlock DAO** and funded by proceeds
from the NFT mint.

**Token Utilities**

**1. Rewards & Incentives**

-   Periodic \$WLOCK distribution to NFT holders based on tier (Shrimp,
    Crab, Shark, Dolphin, Whale, Humpback).

-   Additional rewards for active engagement on **Discord**, **X
    (Twitter)**, and community events.

-   Thematic or monthly airdrops for higher-tier members.

**2. Staking & Lock Rewards**

-   NFT and token staking with passive earnings.

-   ["]{dir="rtl"}Lock-to-Earn" system: longer lock duration = higher
    reward multiplier.

-   Dedicated staking pools for OG members and early supporters.

**3. Governance**

-   Full DAO-based governance model.

    and partnerships.

**4. Ecosystem Utility**

-   Access to exclusive drops, NFT upgrades, digital merch, events, and
    3D voxel experiences within the WhalesBlock metaverse.

**Model Sustainability**

WhalesBlock adopts a **circular and meritocratic tokenomics model**,
where the token[']{dir="rtl"}s value is directly tied to community
participation.\
Through the **Buyback & Redistribute** mechanism, a portion of NFT mint
revenue and DAO funds are continually reinvested into \$WLOCK to sustain
liquidity and long-term growth.

The model is built upon three guiding principles:

**Transparency** → every transaction is traceable on-chain.

**Meritocracy** → rewards scale with engagement, loyalty, and
contribution.

**Sustainability** → reinvestment of value back into the ecosystem.

**Summary**

\$WLOCK is more than just a token --- it[']{dir="rtl"}s the **bond that
unites the digital ocean of WhalesBlock**.\
Each locked block of value symbolizes trust, belonging, and shared
creation.

*["]{dir="rtl"}Those who lock, build."*\
*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale is part of the ocean."* 🌊
