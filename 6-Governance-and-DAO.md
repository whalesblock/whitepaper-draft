# Governance and DAO

6. Governance & DAO Structure**

**Introduction**

The governance model of **WhalesBlock** is designed to ensure
**transparency, participation, and autonomy**.\
Through the **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**, every
community member can actively contribute to the project[']{dir="rtl"}s
development, propose initiatives, and vote on key decisions shaping the
future of the ecosystem.

Governance is not an accessory element but one of
WhalesBlock[']{dir="rtl"}s **core pillars** --- a system where **the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s value and direction are determined
collectively**, not by a central entity.

**DAO Objectives**

**Decentralize Decision-Making**\
All major choices --- from treasury management to partnership strategy
--- are discussed and voted on by the community.

**Reward Active Participation**\
Users contributing ideas, time, or resources gain direct benefits in
terms of governance power, visibility, and rewards.

**Ensure Transparency and Sustainability**\
Every DAO operation is tracked on-chain.\
Transactions, allocations, and proposals are public and verifiable by
anyone.

**DAO Structure**

The **WhalesBlock DAO** is organized across multiple tiers, balancing
**participation and responsibility**.\
Each level comes with specific roles, privileges, and voting rights.

  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------- ----------
  **Tier**         **Name**       **Requirements**                  **Main
                                                                    Rights**

  🦐 **Member**    1+ NFT         Access to DAO and ability to vote 
                                  on minor proposals.               

  🦈 **Core Holder 10+ NFT or     Voting power on operational

                   NFT                                              

  🧱 **Founders &  Selected       Coordination of votes, technical  
  Council**        founding       review, and ensuring impartial    
                   members        governance.                       
  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------- ----------

*All votes are executed on-chain, and the results are public and
immutable.*

**Voting Mechanism**

The DAO uses a **weighted voting system** based on **NFTs held + \$WLOCK
tokens staked**.\
Each wallet has a voting weight proportional to its contribution to the
ecosystem:

Voting Power

=

(

NFT Tier Value

)

\+

(

Tokens Staked

×

Weight Factor

)

\\text{Voting Power} = (\\text{NFT Tier Value}) + (\\text{Tokens Staked}
\\times \\text{Weight Factor})

Voting Power=(NFT Tier Value)+(Tokens Staked×Weight Factor)

**Example:**

-   1 Whale NFT = 5 voting points

-   1 Shark NFT = 3 voting points

-   1,000 \$WLOCK staked = 1 voting point

This system is designed to **reward active contributors**, not just
token accumulators.\
Additionally, high-engagement users (DAO Ambassadors, Artists, Dev
Contributors) may receive **temporary bonus voting power** based on
merit.

**DAO Treasury**

The DAO treasury is the **economic heart** of the project.\
Managed through a **multi-signature wallet** and publicly verifiable, it
collects funds from:

-   NFT royalties (secondary markets)

-   Staking or internal transaction fees

-   Primary mint revenue

-   Scheduled \$WLOCK buybacks

-   Donations and partnerships

**Treasury Utilization**

-   Funding marketing campaigns and cross-chain collaborations

-   Airdrops and community rewards

-   Technical development and platform maintenance

-   Liquidity provisioning and management

-   Artistic and social initiatives tied to the WhalesBlock brand

All treasury spending must be approved through a **DAO vote**, requiring
a minimum **51% quorum**.

**Community Roles**

🧠 **Founder Tier**

Original members of the project who oversee and guide strategic
development, ensuring alignment between artistic, economic, and
community vision.

🌊 **DAO Ambassadors**

Represent the project across social platforms (X, Discord).\
They handle onboarding, moderation, and direct communication with new
members.

🧰 **Dev & Creative Contributors**

Developers, artists, and designers who actively improve the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s technical or visual aspects, compensated in
\$WLOCK or NFTs.

💬 **Active Members**

Regular participants in voting, events, and community activities.\
They earn XP and access to periodic DAO reward programs.

**Governance Evolution**

The WhalesBlock governance model is **evolutionary**:\
as the community grows, the DAO will progressively implement advanced
mechanisms such as:

**On-chain Smart Proposals** (automated proposal execution)

**Voting-as-Staking** (rewarding active voters)

**Delegated Voting** (temporary representation rights)

The goal is to build an increasingly **autonomous, transparent, and
community-driven** structure where members truly shape the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s direction.

**Summary**

WhalesBlock governance is not just a voting mechanism ---
it[']{dir="rtl"}s a **decision-making ecosystem built on trust and
contribution**.\
Every NFT, every token, and every active member strengthens the network,
adding a new ["]{dir="rtl"}block" to the shared digital ocean.

*["]{dir="rtl"}Power is not owned --- it[']{dir="rtl"}s built
together."*\
*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale is a voice in the ocean."* 🌊
