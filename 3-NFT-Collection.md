# NFT Collection

3. NFT Collection**

**Style and Design**

The **WhalesBlock** collection consists of original, entirely hand-drawn
artworks in **3D pixel style** --- a modern reinterpretation of
traditional pixel art, where each element gains depth and volume.\
Every NFT is the result of meticulous manual design, featuring details
inspired by voxel aesthetics and the signature **Solana color palette**:
purple, turquoise, and aqua green --- symbols of energy, liquidity, and
innovation.

The collection draws inspiration from the **animal metaphors used in
trading tools**, where each creature represents a specific investor
profile and behavioral archetype within the market.

**Blockchain:** Solana

**Standard:** SPL NFT

**Total Supply:** 3,333

**Visual Format:** 3D Pixel Art

**Unique Designs:** 100% hand-made

**Utility:** Access to rewards, staking, airdrops, and community status

Each NFT is an integral part of the **visual and conceptual identity**
of WhalesBlock and serves as a **key to access** its broader ecosystem.\
Owning multiple NFTs increases the holder[']{dir="rtl"}s **status and
tier**, unlocking proportional advantages in terms of **\$WHALE tokens,
governance rights, and monthly rewards.**

**4. Tokenomics --- \$WLOCK (WhaleLock Token)**

**Introduction**

The **\$WLOCK Token** serves as the economic engine of the
**WhalesBlock** ecosystem, embodying the principles of **community,
value, and solidity**.\
The name *WhaleLock* combines two symbolic elements:

**["]{dir="rtl"}Whales + Block"**, a direct link to the WhalesBlock
brand;

**["]{dir="rtl"}Lock"**, representing commitment, trust, and the secure
nature of liquidity within the ecosystem.

The token is launched through a **fair-launch on
[[pump.fun]{.underline}](https://pump.fun/)**, ensuring a **transparent,
decentralized, and equitable distribution**.\
There are no presales, no private allocations, and no insider advantages
--- every participant enters under the same conditions, reinforcing the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s philosophy:

*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale builds its own block."*

**Core Specifications**

**Token Name:** WhaleLock Token

**Symbol:** \$WLOCK

**Blockchain:** Solana

**Standard:** SPL Token

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 \$WLOCK *(automatically generated via
pump.fun)*

**Launch:** Fair-launch on pump.fun

**Liquidity:** Automatically locked on Raydium once the target market
cap threshold is reached

**Tax:** 0% (no buy/sell tax to ensure full trading freedom)

**Token Distribution (pump.fun model)**

Because pump.fun does not support private or manual pre-allocations,
\$WLOCK[']{dir="rtl"}s distribution will occur **organically and
progressively** after launch, through **buyback and redistribution
mechanisms** managed by the **WhalesBlock DAO** and funded by proceeds
from the NFT mint.

                                        future development.
  ------------------ ------------------ -----------------------------------------------

*Note: All operational wallets will be publicly visible and fully
traceable on-chain to ensure maximum transparency.*

**Token Utilities**

**1. Rewards & Incentives**

-   Periodic \$WLOCK distribution to NFT holders based on tier (Shrimp,
    Crab, Shark, Dolphin, Whale, Humpback).

-   Additional rewards for active engagement on **Discord**, **X
    (Twitter)**, and community events.

-   Thematic or monthly airdrops for higher-tier members.

**2. Staking & Lock Rewards**

-   NFT and token staking with passive earnings.

-   ["]{dir="rtl"}Lock-to-Earn" system: longer lock duration = higher
    reward multiplier.

-   Dedicated staking pools for OG members and early supporters.

**3. Governance**

-   Full DAO-based governance model.

-   Holders of \$WLOCK and special ["]{dir="rtl"}Founder Tier" NFTs can
    propose and vote on decisions related to development, treasury use,
    and partnerships.

**4. Ecosystem Utility**

-   Access to exclusive drops, NFT upgrades, digital merch, events, and
    3D voxel experiences within the WhalesBlock metaverse.

**Model Sustainability**

WhalesBlock adopts a **circular and meritocratic tokenomics model**,
where the token[']{dir="rtl"}s value is directly tied to community
participation.\
Through the **Buyback & Redistribute** mechanism, a portion of NFT mint
revenue and DAO funds are continually reinvested into \$WLOCK to sustain
liquidity and long-term growth.

The model is built upon three guiding principles:

**Transparency** → every transaction is traceable on-chain.

**Meritocracy** → rewards scale with engagement, loyalty, and
contribution.

**Sustainability** → reinvestment of value back into the ecosystem.

**Summary**

\$WLOCK is more than just a token --- it[']{dir="rtl"}s the **bond that
unites the digital ocean of WhalesBlock**.\
Each locked block of value symbolizes trust, belonging, and shared
creation.

*["]{dir="rtl"}Those who lock, build."*\
*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale is part of the ocean."* 🌊

**5. Engagement & Reward System**

**Introduction**

The **Engagement & Reward System** is the beating heart of the
**WhalesBlock** community.\
It is built on a simple yet powerful principle: **those who participate,
grow**.

Through a tier-based model inspired by marine species and trading
archetypes, every member can climb ranks and unlock privileges according
to their level of involvement, number of NFTs held, and long-term
loyalty.

This system turns active engagement into tangible value, creating a
dynamic, meritocratic, and sustainable ecosystem.

**Tier Structure**

Every member of the community belongs to a **marine species tier**,
determined by the number of NFTs they own and their engagement score.\
These levels are not just symbolic --- they define **real benefits,
airdrops, and staking rewards**.

  ----------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------ ------------
  **Tier**          **Name**   **Minimum Requirement**                    **Key

  Tier)**                      staking rewards.                           
  ----------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------ ------------

*Note: Tier progression is dynamic and may evolve over time based on
both on-chain and off-chain activity.*

**Scoring System (XP & Loyalty)**

In parallel with NFT tiers, each user accumulates **XP points**,
representing their ongoing participation and contribution.\
XP is calculated weekly and directly influences **airdrop eligibility
and \$WLOCK reward multipliers**.

**Main XP Sources**

-   ✅ **Holding WhalesBlock NFTs**\
    → The more NFTs you hold, the more XP you accumulate over time.

-   🗣 **Discord / X (Twitter) Engagement**\
    → Likes, reposts, mentions, and meaningful community contributions.

-   🎯 **Weekly Missions**\
    → Thematic challenges and creative community tasks.

-   💎 **DAO Participation**\
    → Voting, proposal engagement, and contribution to governance
    discussions.

-   🐚 **On-Chain Activity**\
    → Staking, \$WLOCK transactions, NFT mints, and other blockchain
    interactions.

XP will be visible in a dedicated dashboard (under development) and can
be redeemed for periodic rewards, bonus NFTs, or special tier upgrades.

**Reward Mechanisms**

Holders of WhalesBlock NFTs and the \$WLOCK token will receive
**periodic rewards** based on their tier level and XP performance.\
Rewards are distributed through **three primary channels**:

**1. Periodic Airdrops**

-   Monthly \$WLOCK distributions based on tier and XP ranking.

-   Loyalty bonuses for long-term holders.

-   On-chain snapshots used to identify eligible wallets.

**2. Staking Incentives**

-   Additional rewards for locking NFTs or \$WLOCK tokens for extended
    periods.

-   Yield multipliers based on lock duration and tier level.

-   Exclusive staking pools for higher-tier members (Whale & Humpback).

**3. Community Events & Missions**

-   Special campaigns featuring NFT or \$WLOCK prizes.

-   Creative challenges (*meme contests, art events, lore creation,
    build competitions*).

-   Cross-reward collaborations with partner projects on Solana.

**Role of the WhalesBlock DAO**

The **WhalesBlock DAO** governs all major reward-related decisions in a
transparent and democratic way:

-   Manages reward distribution cycles.

-   Adjusts tier thresholds based on community growth.

-   Oversees partnerships, buybacks, and treasury allocation.

Whale and Humpback members hold **governance priority**, ensuring
self-management and meritocracy throughout the ecosystem.

**Summary**

The *Engagement & Reward System* turns NFT and token ownership into
**active participation and collective progress**.\
WhalesBlock rewards those who contribute, build, and believe in the
long-term vision.\
Every action, every block, and every whale matters.

*["]{dir="rtl"}Value flows from the ocean."*\
*["]{dir="rtl"}The deeper you dive, the greater your rewards."* 🌊

**6. Governance & DAO Structure**

**Introduction**

The governance model of **WhalesBlock** is designed to ensure
**transparency, participation, and autonomy**.\
Through the **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**, every
community member can actively contribute to the project[']{dir="rtl"}s
development, propose initiatives, and vote on key decisions shaping the
future of the ecosystem.

Governance is not an accessory element but one of
WhalesBlock[']{dir="rtl"}s **core pillars** --- a system where **the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s value and direction are determined
collectively**, not by a central entity.

**DAO Objectives**

**Decentralize Decision-Making**\
All major choices --- from treasury management to partnership strategy
--- are discussed and voted on by the community.

**Reward Active Participation**\
Users contributing ideas, time, or resources gain direct benefits in
terms of governance power, visibility, and rewards.

**Ensure Transparency and Sustainability**\
Every DAO operation is tracked on-chain.\
Transactions, allocations, and proposals are public and verifiable by
anyone.

**DAO Structure**

The **WhalesBlock DAO** is organized across multiple tiers, balancing
**participation and responsibility**.\
Each level comes with specific roles, privileges, and voting rights.

  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------- ----------
  **Tier**         **Name**       **Requirements**                  **Main
                                                                    Rights**

  🦐 **Member**    1+ NFT         Access to DAO and ability to vote 
                                  on minor proposals.               

  🦈 **Core Holder 10+ NFT or     Voting power on operational

  🧱 **Founders &  Selected       Coordination of votes, technical  
  Council**        founding       review, and ensuring impartial    
                   members        governance.                       
  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------- ----------

*All votes are executed on-chain, and the results are public and
immutable.*

**Voting Mechanism**

The DAO uses a **weighted voting system** based on **NFTs held + \$WLOCK
tokens staked**.\
Each wallet has a voting weight proportional to its contribution to the
ecosystem:

Voting Power

=

(

NFT Tier Value

)

\+

(

Tokens Staked

×

Weight Factor

)

\\text{Voting Power} = (\\text{NFT Tier Value}) + (\\text{Tokens Staked}
\\times \\text{Weight Factor})

Voting Power=(NFT Tier Value)+(Tokens Staked×Weight Factor)

**Example:**

-   1 Whale NFT = 5 voting points

-   1 Shark NFT = 3 voting points

-   1,000 \$WLOCK staked = 1 voting point

This system is designed to **reward active contributors**, not just
token accumulators.\
Additionally, high-engagement users (DAO Ambassadors, Artists, Dev
Contributors) may receive **temporary bonus voting power** based on
merit.

**DAO Treasury**

The DAO treasury is the **economic heart** of the project.\
Managed through a **multi-signature wallet** and publicly verifiable, it
collects funds from:

-   NFT royalties (secondary markets)

-   Staking or internal transaction fees

-   Primary mint revenue

-   Scheduled \$WLOCK buybacks

-   Donations and partnerships

**Treasury Utilization**

-   Funding marketing campaigns and cross-chain collaborations

-   Airdrops and community rewards

-   Technical development and platform maintenance

-   Liquidity provisioning and management

-   Artistic and social initiatives tied to the WhalesBlock brand

All treasury spending must be approved through a **DAO vote**, requiring
a minimum **51% quorum**.

**Community Roles**

🧠 **Founder Tier**

Original members of the project who oversee and guide strategic
development, ensuring alignment between artistic, economic, and
community vision.

🌊 **DAO Ambassadors**

Represent the project across social platforms (X, Discord).\
They handle onboarding, moderation, and direct communication with new
members.

🧰 **Dev & Creative Contributors**

Developers, artists, and designers who actively improve the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s technical or visual aspects, compensated in
\$WLOCK or NFTs.

💬 **Active Members**

Regular participants in voting, events, and community activities.\
They earn XP and access to periodic DAO reward programs.

**Governance Evolution**

The WhalesBlock governance model is **evolutionary**:\
as the community grows, the DAO will progressively implement advanced
mechanisms such as:

**On-chain Smart Proposals** (automated proposal execution)

**Voting-as-Staking** (rewarding active voters)

**Delegated Voting** (temporary representation rights)

The goal is to build an increasingly **autonomous, transparent, and
community-driven** structure where members truly shape the
project[']{dir="rtl"}s direction.

**Summary**

WhalesBlock governance is not just a voting mechanism ---
it[']{dir="rtl"}s a **decision-making ecosystem built on trust and
contribution**.\
Every NFT, every token, and every active member strengthens the network,
adding a new ["]{dir="rtl"}block" to the shared digital ocean.

*["]{dir="rtl"}Power is not owned --- it[']{dir="rtl"}s built
together."*\
*["]{dir="rtl"}Every Whale is a voice in the ocean."* 🌊

**8. Conclusion & Future Vision**

**Beyond the Ocean**

WhalesBlock is more than just an NFT project or a memecoin --- it is a
**collective narrative** that merges art, economy, and community.\
Every collector, trader, or enthusiast who joins WhalesBlock contributes
to shaping a fragment of the digital ocean --- a living, evolving
environment built upon **participation, transparency, and creativity**.

Like the ocean itself, the WhalesBlock ecosystem thrives on **currents,
motion, and balance among its species**.\
Each NFT, each token, and each member represents a vital unit that
strengthens and sustains the network.

**A Decentralized Vision**

WhalesBlock[']{dir="rtl"}s direction is not dictated from the top down
--- it is **community-driven**, guided by those who believe in the
project and help it grow each day.\
The mission is to move beyond speculation and build **real value**,
powered by collective contribution and engagement.

Through the DAO, the \$WLOCK token, and the Ocean Tiers system,
WhalesBlock establishes a **merit-based structure** where dedication is
rewarded and every voice plays a role in decision-making.\
Art becomes the language, blockchain becomes the tool, and the community
becomes the creative force.

**Expansion & Innovation**

Looking ahead, WhalesBlock will continue to evolve along three main
directions:

**Art & Identity** -- expanding the visual universe through new
collections, collaborations, and 3D voxel/pixel-inspired styles.

**Ecosystem & Utility** -- developing tools, gamified staking, and DAO
mechanics that encourage long-term engagement.

**Community & Culture** -- promoting events, partnerships, and social
initiatives that bridge Web3 and the real world.

The ultimate goal is to create an **open, interoperable, and creative
ecosystem**, connecting digital art, decentralized finance, and
participatory culture.

**The WhalesBlock Philosophy**

In a fast-moving market, WhalesBlock stands for a **moment of mindful
creation** ---\
a space where growth is not measured only by volume or floor price, but
by **real connections and shared value**.

The essence of the project can be summed up in three words:

**Build. Share. Grow.**

Every Whale, every Shrimp, every block is part of something greater ---\
a **collective ocean of ideas, art, and vision** that flows beyond the
borders of Web3.

*["]{dir="rtl"}The ocean belongs to no one, yet it lives within those
who cross it."* 🌊
