# Engagement and Rewards

5. Engagement & Reward System**

**Introduction**

The **Engagement & Reward System** is the beating heart of the
**WhalesBlock** community.\
It is built on a simple yet powerful principle: **those who participate,
grow**.

Through a tier-based model inspired by marine species and trading
archetypes, every member can climb ranks and unlock privileges according
to their level of involvement, number of NFTs held, and long-term
loyalty.

This system turns active engagement into tangible value, creating a
dynamic, meritocratic, and sustainable ecosystem.

**Tier Structure**

Every member of the community belongs to a **marine species tier**,
determined by the number of NFTs they own and their engagement score.\
These levels are not just symbolic --- they define **real benefits,
airdrops, and staking rewards**.

*Note: Tier progression is dynamic and may evolve over time based on
both on-chain and off-chain activity.*

**Scoring System (XP & Loyalty)**

In parallel with NFT tiers, each user accumulates **XP points**,
representing their ongoing participation and contribution.\
XP is calculated weekly and directly influences **airdrop eligibility
and \$WLOCK reward multipliers**.

**Main XP Sources**

-   ✅ **Holding WhalesBlock NFTs**\
    → The more NFTs you hold, the more XP you accumulate over time.

-   🗣 **Discord / X (Twitter) Engagement**\
    → Likes, reposts, mentions, and meaningful community contributions.

-   🎯 **Weekly Missions**\
    → Thematic challenges and creative community tasks.

-   💎 **DAO Participation**\
    → Voting, proposal engagement, and contribution to governance
    discussions.

-   🐚 **On-Chain Activity**\
    → Staking, \$WLOCK transactions, NFT mints, and other blockchain
    interactions.

XP will be visible in a dedicated dashboard (under development) and can
be redeemed for periodic rewards, bonus NFTs, or special tier upgrades.

**Reward Mechanisms**

Holders of WhalesBlock NFTs and the \$WLOCK token will receive
**periodic rewards** based on their tier level and XP performance.\
Rewards are distributed through **three primary channels**:

**1. Periodic Airdrops**

-   Monthly \$WLOCK distributions based on tier and XP ranking.

-   Loyalty bonuses for long-term holders.

-   On-chain snapshots used to identify eligible wallets.

**2. Staking Incentives**

-   Additional rewards for locking NFTs or \$WLOCK tokens for extended
    periods.

-   Yield multipliers based on lock duration and tier level.

-   Exclusive staking pools for higher-tier members (Whale & Humpback).

**3. Community Events & Missions**

-   Special campaigns featuring NFT or \$WLOCK prizes.

-   Creative challenges (*meme contests, art events, lore creation,
    build competitions*).

-   Cross-reward collaborations with partner projects on Solana.

**Role of the WhalesBlock DAO**

The **WhalesBlock DAO** governs all major reward-related decisions in a
transparent and democratic way:

-   Manages reward distribution cycles.

-   Adjusts tier thresholds based on community growth.

-   Oversees partnerships, buybacks, and treasury allocation.

Whale and Humpback members hold **governance priority**, ensuring
self-management and meritocracy throughout the ecosystem.

**Summary**

The *Engagement & Reward System* turns NFT and token ownership into
**active participation and collective progress**.\
WhalesBlock rewards those who contribute, build, and believe in the
long-term vision.\
Every action, every block, and every whale matters.
